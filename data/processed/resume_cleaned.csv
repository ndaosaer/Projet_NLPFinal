WORK EXPERINCE
Title : Wipro Neural Intelligence Platform
Team Size : 5
Brief: Wiproâs Neural Intelligence Platform harnesses the power of automation and artificial intelligence
technologiesânatural language processing (NLP), cognitive, machine learning, and analytics. The platform
comprises three layers: a data engagement platform that can easily access and manage multiple structured and
unstructured data sources; an âintent assessment and reasoningâ engine that includes sentiment and predictive
analytics; and a deep machine learning engine that can sense, act, and learn over time. The project entailed
automating responses to user queries at the earliest. The Monster Bot using the power of Deep Machine Learning,
NLP to handle such queries. User can see the how their queries can be answered quickly like allL1 activities can be
eliminated.
Entity Extractor -> This involves text extraction and NLP for fetching out important information from the text like
dates, names, places, contact numbers etc. This involves Regex, Bluemix NLU apiâs and machine learning using
Tensor flow for further learning of new entities.
Classifier ->This involves the classifications of classes, training of dataset and predicting the output using the SKLearn
classifier (MNB, SVM, SGD as Classifier) and SGD for the optimization to map the user queries with the best
suited response and make the system efficient.
NER: A Deep Learning NER Model is trained to extract the entities from the text. Entities like Roles, Skills,
Organizations can be extracted from raw text. RNN(LSTM) Bidirectional model is trained for extracting such entities
using Keras TensorFlow framework.

Data warehouse division has multiple products for injecting, storing, analysing and presenting data. The Data Lake program is started to provide multi-talent, secure data hub to store application's data on Hadoop platform with strong data governance, lineage, auditing and monitoring capabilities. The object of the project is to provide necessary engineering support to analytics and application teams so that they can focus on the business logic development. In this project, the major task is to set up the Hadoop cluster and govern all the activities which are required for the smooth functioning of various Hadoop ecosystems. As the day and day data increasing so to provide stability to the ecosystem and smooth working of it, Developing and automating the various requirement specific utilities.

Responsibility 1. Developed proactive Health Check utility for Data Lake. The utility proactively checks the smooth functioning of all Hadoop components on the cluster and sends the result to email in HTML format. The utility is being used for daily Health Checks as well as after upgrades.
2. Getting the data in different formats and processing the data in Hadoop ecosystem after filtering the data using the appropriate techniques.
3. Developed data pipeline utility to ingest data from RDBMS database to Hive external tables using Sqoop commands. The utility also offers the data quality check like row count validation.
4. Developed and automated various cluster health check, usage, capacity related reports using Unix shell scripting.
5. Optimization of hive queries in order to increase the performance and minimize the Hadoop resource utilizations.
6. Creating flume agents to process the data to Hadoop ecosystem side.
7. Performed benchmark testing on the Hive Queries and impala queries.
8. Involved in setting up the cluster and its components like edge node and HA implementation of the services: Hive Server2, Impala, and HDFS.
9. Filtering the required data from available data using different technologies like pig, regex Serde etc.
10. Dataiku benchmark testing on top of impala and hive in compare to Greenplum database.
11. Moving the data from Greenplum database to Hadoop side with help of Sqoop pipeline, process the data to Hadoop side and storing the data into hive tables to do the performance testing.
12. Dealing with the Hadoop ecosystem related issues in order to provide stability to WM Hadoop ecosystem.
13. Rescheduling of job from autosys job hosting to TWS job hosting for better performance.

Migration of data from RDBMS database to Hive (Hadoop ecosystem) . Hadoop platform ability with strong data governance, lineage, auditing and monitoring capabilities. The objective of this project was to speed up the data processing so that the analysis and decision making become easy. Due to RDBMS limitations to process waste amount of data at once and produce the results at the earliest, Client wanted to move the data to Hadoop ecosystem so that they can over-come from those limitations and focus on business improvement only.

Responsibility 1. Optimising the SQL queries for those data which were not required to move from RDBMS to any other platform.
2. Writing the Hive queries and logic to move the data from RDBMS to Hadoop ecosystem.
3. Writing the hive queries to analyse the required data as per the business requirements.
4. Optimization of hive queries in order to increase the performance and minimize the Hadoop resource utilizations.
5. Writing the sqoop commands and scripts to move the data from RDBMS to Hadoop side.

Project Description:
The bank wanted to help its customers to avail different products of the bank through analyzing their expenditure behavior. The customers spending ranges from online shopping, medical expenses in hospitals, cash transactions, and debit card usage etc. the behavior allows the bank to create an analytical report and based on which the bank used to display the product offers on the customer portal which was built using java. The portal allows the customers to login and see their transactions which they make on a day to day basis .the analytics also help the customers plan their budgets through the budget watch and my financial forecast applications embedded into the portal. The portal used hadoop framework to analyes the data as per the rules and regulations placed by the regulators from the respective countries. The offers and the interest rates also complied with the regulations and all these processing was done using the hadoop framework as big data analytics system.

Project Description:
Pfizer Inc. is an American global pharmaceutical corporation headquartered in New York City. The main objective of the project is to build a Development Data Repository for Pfizer Inc. Because all the downstream application are like Etrack, TSP database, RTS, SADMS, GFS, GDO having their own sql request on the OLTP system directly due to which the performance of OLTP system goes slows down. For this we have created a Development Data Repository to replace the entire sql request directly on the OLTP system. DDR process extracts all clinical, pre-clinical, study, product, subject, sites related information from the upstream applications like EPECS, CDSS, RCM, PRC, E-CLINICAL, EDH and after applying some business logic put it into DDR core tables. From these snapshot and dimensional layer are created which are used for reporting application.

Role & Responsibilities:
â To understand & analyze the requirement documents and resolve the queries.
â To design Informatica mappings by using various basic transformations like Filter, Router, Source qualifier, Lookup etc and advance transformations like Aggregators, Joiner, Sorters and so on.
â Perform cross Unit and Integration testing for mappings developed within the team. Reporting bugs and bug fixing.
â Create workflow/batches and set the session dependencies.
â Implemented Change Data Capture using mapping parameters, SCD and SK generation.
â Developed Mapplet, reusable transformations to populate the data into data warehouse.
â Created Sessions & Worklets using workflow Manager to load the data into the Target Database.
â Involved in Unit Case Testing (UTC)
â Performing Unit Testing and UAT for SCD Type1/Type2, fact load and CDC implementation.

Project Description:
The objective is to implement a strategic technical solution to support the governance and monitoring of break standards - including enhancements to audit capabilities. As a part of this program, the required remediation of source system data feeds involves consolidation of data into standardized feeds.

These remediated data feeds will be consumed by ETL layer. The reconciliation tool is
designed to source data from an ETL layer. The data from the Front and Back office systems,
together with static data must therefore be delivered to ETL. Here it will be pre-processed and delivered to reconciliation tool before the reconciliation process can be performed.
